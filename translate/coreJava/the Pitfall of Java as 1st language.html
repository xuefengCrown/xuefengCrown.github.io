The Pitfalls of Java as a First Programming Language

<h3>
 <font color="#00DB00">Java作为入门语言的缺点</font>
</h3>
<p>
Because of its popularity in the context of Web applications and the ease with which
beginners can produce graphical programs, Java has become the most widely used language 
in introductory programming courses. We consider this to be a misguided attempt to make 
programming more fun, perhaps in reaction to the drop in CS enrollments that followed the 
dot-com bust. What we observed at New York University is that the Java programming
courses did not prepare our students for the first course in systems, much less for
more advanced ones. Students found it hard to write programs that did not have a
graphic interface, had no feeling for the relationship between the source program
and what the hardware would actually do, and (most damaging) did not understand
the semantics of pointers at all, which made the use of C in systems programming very challenging.
</p>
<p>
因为web应用的流行，以及开发图形化程序的便捷性，Java成为最广泛的编程入门语言。
我们认为这是一个为使编程变得有趣的错误尝试，也许只是为了应对互联网泡沫后的CS招生的不景气。
我们在纽约大学观察到，以Java编程作为入门课程没有帮助学生为学习更高级课程做好准备，如系统方面课程。
学生觉得很难写那些没有图形接口的程序，对于源程序和硬件实际所做之间的关系没什么感觉，最要命的是，
根本不理解指针语义，（指针可是C在系统编程方面那么叼的原因）。
</p>
<p>
Let us propose the following principle: The irresistible beauty of programming
consists in the reduction of complex formal processes to a very small set of primitive operations. 
Java, instead of exposing this beauty, encourages the programmer to
approach problem-solving like a plumber in a hardware store: by rummaging through
a multitude of drawers (i.e. packages) we will end up finding some gadget (i.e. class)
that does roughly what we want. How it does it is not interesting! The result is a student 
who knows how to put a simple program together, but does not know how to
program. A further pitfall of the early use of Java libraries and frameworks is that it is
impossible for the student to develop a sense of the run-time cost of what is written 
because it is extremely hard to know what any method call will eventually execute. 
A lucid analysis of the problem is presented in [4].
</p>
<p>
我们严重认为：编程的不可抗拒的美在于，将复杂的形式过程降低到一个非常小的基本操作集合（primitive operations）。
Java，没有显示出这种美，而是驱使程序员像个五金店的水管工一样去解决问题，通过在一个很大的工具箱中（所谓包）到处
搜寻翻找某个工具（他们管它叫class）。这简直没有一点意思！结果就是——学生仅仅知道如何把小程序组合在一起，
但是不知道如何编程。另一个缺点是，上来就使用Java库和框架来编程是无法培养学生对程序运行消耗的感觉和认识，
因为很难了解某个方法的调用将执行的是什么。
</p>
<p>
We are seeing some backlash to this approach. For example, Bjarne Stroustrup
reports from Texas A & M University that the industry is showing increasing unhappiness 
with the results of this approach.
Specifically, he notes the following:
</p>
<p>
有很多对这种方法的反对，Bjarne Stroustrup说工业界对于这种方法导致的结果很不满意，他特别指出：
</p>
<p>
I have had a lot of complaints about that [the use of Java as a first programming language] 
from industry, specifically from AT&T, IBM, Intel, Bloomberg, NI, Microsoft, Lockheed-Martin, and more. [5]
</p>
<p>
我了解很多来自工业界的对此（以Java编程作为入门）的抱怨，像AT&T, IBM, Intel, Bloomberg, NI, Microsoft, Lockheed-Martin。。。
</p>
<p>
He noted in a private discussion on this topic, reporting the following:
</p>
<p>
他随后在聊天中谈到：我们也是以Java作为入门，现在转向C++。
</p>
<p>
It [Texas A&M] did [teach Java as the first language]. Then I started
teaching C++ to the electrical engineers and when the EE students
started to out-program the CS students, the CS department switched
to C++. [5]
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see how many departments follow this trend. At
AdaCore, we are certainly aware of many universities that have adopted Ada as a first
language because of similar concerns.
</p>
<p>
看到这些变化很有意思。在AdaCore，我们得知很多大学也基于同样原因而使用Ada作为入门语言。
</p>
<h3>
 <font color="#00DB00">A Real Programmer Can Write in Any Language (C, Java, Lisp, Ada)</font>
</h3>
<p>
Software professionals of a certain age will remember the slogan of old-timers from
two generations ago when structured programming became the rage: Real programmers 
can write Fortran in any language.
</p>
<p>
年纪长点的专业程序员应该还记得，两代之前的口号，那时正是结构化编程（structured program）流行
之时：真正的（real）程序员能够用任何语言来写Fortran程序。
</p>
<p>
The slogan is a reminder of how thinking habits of programmers are influenced by
the first language they learn and how hard it is to shake these habits if you do all your
programming in a single language.
</p>
<p>
这个口号提醒我们，入门语言对于程序员的思维习惯的塑造是巨大的，而且这种习惯很难改变，如果你只用它编程。
</p>
<p>
Conversely, we want to say that a competent programmer is comfortable with a
number of different languages and that the programmer must be able to use the mental 
tools favored by one of them, even when programming in another. For example, 
the user of an imperative language such as Ada or C++ must be able to write
in a functional style, acquired through practice with Lisp and ML 1 , when manipulating
recursive structures. This is one indication of the importance of learning in-depth a
number of different programming languages.
</p>
<p>
What follows summarizes what we think are the critical contributions that well-established languages 
make to the mental tool-set of real programmers. For example, a real programmer should be able
to program inheritance and dynamic dispatching in C, information hiding in Lisp,
tree manipulation libraries in Ada, and garbage collection in anything but Java.
The study of a wide variety of languages is, thus, indispensable to the well-rounded
programmer.
</p>
<p>
相反的，我们想说的是，一个优秀的程序员能够习惯于一系列其他语言，即使偏爱某一个，但是能够自如使用
这些精神工具。例如，使用Ada和C++等命令式语言的，也能写函数式风格的程序，你可以从Lisp和ML中学到这个，
在那里你得频繁操纵递归结构。由此可见，深入学习其他语言的重要性。
</p>
<p>
下面我们汇总了一些我们认为很重要的语言，它们设计良好，可以作为你的精良武器库的一部分。
比如，一个现实中的程序员能够在C中写继承和动态分派（dynamic dispatching），能够在Lisp中做到数据隐藏，
能够在Ada中写出进行树操作的库，能够在非Java中写出垃圾收集。
</p>
<p>
学习其他编程语言，对于要成为一个全面的程序员来说是不可缺少的。
