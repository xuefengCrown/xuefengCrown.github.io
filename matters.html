				<h4>我们总是还不知道问题是什么，就开始四处张望，寻找答案。</h4>
				Half the battle is knowing what problem to solve. When initially approached, 
				most problems have no simple, precise specification. 
				<h4>formal model?</h4>
				If certain aspects of a problem can be expressed in terms of a formal model, it is usually
				beneficial to do so, for once a problem is formalized, we can look for solutions in terms of
				a precise model and determine whether a program already exists to solve that problem.
				Even if there is no existing program, at least we can discover what is known about this
				model and use the properties of the model to help construct a good solution.
				<h4>本科应该学数学，研究生阶段再学习计算机科学</h4>
				Almost any branch of mathematics or science can be called into service to help model
				some problem domain. Problems essentially numerical in nature can be modeled by such
				common mathematical concepts as simultaneous linear equations (e.g., finding currents in
				electrical circuits, or finding stresses in frames made of connected beams) or differential
				equations (e.g., predicting population growth or the rate at which chemicals will react).
				Symbol and text processing problems can be modeled by character strings and formal
				grammars. Problems of this nature include compilation (the translation of programs written
				in a programming language into machine language) and information retrieval tasks such as
				recognizing particular words in lists of titles owned by a library.

				<h4>学习数学或历史，而后学习计算机科学</h4>
				那些表面的东西都没有什么价值。通过数学，你学会如何证明，以及怎么处理
				抽象元素。（不过，我很怀疑我们的数学教育能否教会学生这些）通过物理学
				等实验科学和人文学科，你学会如何应用这些抽象在现实中建立联系。
